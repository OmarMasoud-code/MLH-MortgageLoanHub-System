# Mortgage Loan Hub (MLH) System

This project is a simulation of a Mortgage Loan Hub (MLH) system developed for academic purposes. It models borrower–lender interactions through a structured software engineering process that includes user stories, acceptance criteria, interface design in Java, and domain modeling using inheritance.

## 💡 Project Overview

The MLH system allows:
- Borrowers to compare mortgage options, apply for pre-approval, and track their applications.
- Lenders to process applications efficiently using an automated underwriting system and verify financial data from bank accounts.

The system architecture is represented using:
- UML-style user stories and use cases
- A detailed `MLH` Java interface
- Domain classes with inheritance representing financial information, properties, and accounts

---

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ 3 borrower-focused and 2 lender-focused user stories
- ✅ Acceptance criteria mapped to user stories
- ✅ UML use case diagram
- ✅ Java `MLH` interface with 7 core methods
- ✅ Backend domain classes using inheritance for:
  - Employment and Income
  - Assets and Debts
  - Property Information
  - Credit History
  - Account types (Bank, Investment, Real Property, etc.)
