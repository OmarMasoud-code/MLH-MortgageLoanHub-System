# Mortgage Loan Hub (MLH) System

This project is a simulation of a Mortgage Loan Hub (MLH) system developed for academic purposes. It models borrower–lender interactions through a structured software engineering process that includes user stories, acceptance criteria, interface design in Java, and domain modeling using inheritance.

## 💡 Project Overview

The MLH system allows:
- Borrowers to compare mortgage options, apply for pre-approval, and track their applications.
- Lenders to process applications efficiently using an automated underwriting system and verify financial data from bank accounts.

The system architecture is represented using:
- UML-style user stories and use cases
- A detailed `MLH` Java interface
- Domain classes with inheritance representing financial information, properties, and accounts
